Today I learned a lot of things new things like proposition, terminal, interfaces. First I learned about propositions. Proposition is a statement that can either be true or false. It does not depends on opinions or emotions and depends on logic. In computers, they are related to boolean logic. Boolean logic uses true or false values to execute conditions. Proposition can be the combination of two or more statements. Combination of proposition statement uses 'and', 'or'. In programming these are used to make decisions to execute a specific part of the code. A fact is a statement that is always true. Since proposition is a statement that is either true or false, a fact is a true proposition. Because facts do not change.

	
	Next thing I learned was about terminal and why are they used. The terminal is a command line tool. Terminal allows the user to interact or communicate with the computers using commands. CLI means command line interface. The command line interface accepts commands in text from the users. Interface is a medium used to communicate with things. For computers interfaces are monitors, keyboard, mouse are some of the examples of interfaces. Interfaces allows two things to connect. The users can use the interface to communicate and give instructions to the computers. Some of real world examples for interfaces are remote control, car steering wheel, screens on mobile phones. 

	I realised that computers are dumb. They do not think or understand things on their own. They simply follow the commands given to them. They can not make their own decisions unless the programmer programs it to do so. The users can use the terminal to give commands to the computers. One of the important reasons for using the terminal is because they do not depend on the platform. The graphical interface may vary based on the operating system. So using the terminal helps us not to depend on the platform making us to easily adapt to different platforms. Also using terminal makes it easier for developers to work on different softwares without needing to learn the new tool each time. Using terminal is more faster and efficient
Compared to using graphical interface. Using terminal we can install softwares or tools, run programs in a single command line. But doing these things through the graphical interface requires multiple clicks and more steps.

	The next thing I learned is about Git. Git is just something that is used to keep track of what I am doing. It allows us to keep different versions of our projects. As for developers, git helps to collaborate with other developers. Git keeps a history of changes that a person made in the code. So, we can go back to the earlier version if it is needed. Git is also useful so that many people can work on different parts of the project and then merge it together. Git is also portable we can access the code from git without having it in our local storage.

	I also learned to create a file using terminal command and opened it in the text editor, vim. After creating and opening the file I edited it. Then I pushed the file in git using commands like git init, git add ., git commit -m "commit message", git remote add origin <repo url>, git push origin main.

	In summary I learned about propositions and how they are used as boolean in programming. I also understand about why are we using terminals to execute programs and install softwares instead of of graphical interfaces, and I also learned about why git is used and how it helps to track the changes in our code.
